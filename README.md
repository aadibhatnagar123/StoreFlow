# StoreFlow: Professional Inventory & Business Management Suite

StoreFlow is a complete digital solution designed to help businesses track their products, manage customer orders, and analyze sales performance in real-time. Instead of using messy spreadsheets, a business can use StoreFlow to stay organized and secure.

## Why I Built This
I wanted to create a system that felt "enterprise-grade." This means it isn't just a simple website; it is a split system where the "visual part" (what the user sees) and the "brain part" (where the data is stored) work together securely. This separation makes the app faster and much harder to hack.

## How It Works
- **The Dashboard**: As soon as you log in, you see a summary of your business—how much stock you have left and what needs your attention.
- **Product Tracking**: You can add, edit, or remove items from your warehouse with a few clicks.
- **Order Management**: Keeps a history of every sale so nothing gets lost.
- **Support System**: Includes a built-in help desk so staff can report issues directly within the app.
