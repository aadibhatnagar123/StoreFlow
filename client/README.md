# StoreFlow - User Interface (The Client)

This folder contains the "Front-End" of the project. This is the part of the software that the store manager actually interacts with on their screen.

## User-Focused Features
- **Responsive Design**: The app is built to look great and work perfectly whether you are using a large desktop monitor or a tablet.
- **Live Updates**: I focused on making the interface "snappy." When you click a button, the data updates instantly without the whole page needing to reload.
- **Security Checkpoints**: The app is designed to "kick out" anyone who hasn't logged in properly, protecting the business data from unauthorized eyes.

## Personal Design Touch
I chose a clean, minimalist layout for the dashboard. In a busy warehouse environment, managers don't want to hunt for buttons. I placed the "Low Stock Alerts" right at the top so they can take action immediately.
